The OWASP Vulnerable Web Applications Directory Project (VWAD, https://owasp.org/www-project-vulnerable-web-applications-directory/) is a comprehensive and well maintained registry of all known vulnerable web applications currently available.

The three individual lists are available via separate tabs on: [https://owasp.org/www-project-vulnerable-web-applications-directory/](https://owasp.org/www-project-vulnerable-web-applications-directory/) 

## Editing Process

Just open a PR modifying the [appropriate JSON file](https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-VWAD/tree/master/src/data).

Currently (20200331) they are automatically copied/deployed to the `www-project-vulnerable-web-applications-directory` repo, from which they are rendered on the owasp.org website.
